# Largest
Finds the Largest subset of zero-sum numbers.
Using a linked list, this program uses recursion to sort through numbers provided by an input file ("in.txt"), 
determines which numbers in the set are not a part of the largest zero-sum subset and prints the amount of numbers left that it contains.
